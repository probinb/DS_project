Acer Liquid M220 Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Black,ACER,34.95,1,first off  great service as usual i wanted a small windows phone and had seen this phone at the ms store i liked the look  and thought it would work first off  there are no directions for inserting the sim card why would you need directions you ask because after ten minutes of dinking with it i realized that sim  on this phone is a full size sim card exclamation  who has those anymore so  i had to put my sim card in the sim  slot when i did that  every call i made required me to select sim  over sim  also  it was taking way to long for all my apps to load ridiculously too long but the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen its awful you have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those pc security screens from the  s one other reason i was interested in the phone was the textured case i thought it would be easier to grip not its slipperier than the smooth case on my lumina    which id use all the time if it had a front facing camera anyway  if any on you know of a good windows phone with a   screen id appreciate your feedback,50,15,Negative,3.2,1164,228

quality screen nfc android pay compatible decent camera microsd expansioncons awkward button placement squeaky vibrating motor updates not guaranteed no gorilla glassshould you buy yesactual value  i loved my moto g it made me always question why people spend over   on phones when a   could work just as well with the new moto g  i was willing to buy it right on the spot but what turned me off was the nearly   weeks id have to wait for one to be delivered so i started my search for the next best phone under    which lead me to this phone ive had some experience with alcatel phones  so i didnt have much expectations with this phone that being said  ive had a couple of days with it and i can say with absolute confidence that i love it design this is one light phone im starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand i actually thought for a moment that the battery wasnt inside it yet but it is pleasant to hold in the hand the design is all plastic  so dont expect anything premium on this phone like metal but it is solidly built  rivaling even the galaxy s  in build quality speaking of which  this phone is lighter and slimmer than the s  if the phone were sold for more money  id still be satisfied its not just good build quality for the price its excellent build quality period the chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone  which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone no soft touch plastic on this phone  but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints the design is completely symmetrical  which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it id love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white  but that is personal preference overall  i cant find much to complain especially for the low   price performance if you have seen the moto gs specs  youre pretty much getting the same hardware it uses a snapdragon     p display  microsd expansion  android lollipop  and even the same camera module sony imx   however  there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the moto g for instance  this phone has    gb of ram moto g gb  actual front facing stereo speakers  a    compared to the    nfc  and  gb of storagemoto g gb in benchmarks  i have gotten similar results to the moto g in both cpu and graphic performance but benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience the other is daily user experience based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps  i can tell you that this phone is snappy its not as fast as the current flagship lineup  but it never lags or clips the graphics apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth  as well as the transitions from one app to another in my testing of multitasking ability  it opened chrome  angry birds  pokemon puzzle  and youtube with no lag and each app open where i left them off opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save ram  but   apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost games also perform good  as long as you have reasonable expectations  d games such as angry birds  pokemon puzzle  and clash of clans run smoothly and without an issue other games like asphalt   and real racing   will run smooth  but not at the highest quality setting but thats to be expected from a midrange phone signal quality is good i was able to get   mbps download speed and   mbps upload on t mobiles  g lte around pasadena  ca thanks to band   support  cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under   bars the speakers are also amazingly good and loud  coming close to matching htcs boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from jbl overall  it performs close to flagship specs  albeit a bit slower most people should be happy with this phone display the phone itself has a beautiful hd display with a   ppi note that the iphone   has a   ppi and it is advertise as being calibrated by technicolor while they arent at the s s quality display  it does come close the display has a nice color calibration  with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites it is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing it isnt perfect since there are a couple of issues the colors do have a very slight cool tone  meaning that the whites do have a tiny bit of blue to them another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace but it isnt noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone one crucial one is the fact that they arent using gorilla glass on this display  opting for the more discreet dragontrail glass since this is going to be my daily driver  i didnt want to test the toughness if alcatel provides me a unit  id gladly test it but ive looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness it might be easier to scratch it  but it is more resistant to shock only time will tell and i will update this review as time moves on camera the camera is a back facing   mp camera and a front  wide angle   mp camera the rear camera uses a sony exmor imx    which is the same unit found in the new moto g and the more expensive nexus   the results are mixed though on one side  outdoor pictures are good whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room  the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details however  during the night  the picture quality takes a hit  with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light it will get some details if they is any type of light  but not much the lack of ois also contributes to this issue  but there is no phone with ois at this price range at the moment the flash is okay  but since it isnt a dual tone unit  the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details videos are also a similar story  with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true there is eis  but the effect isnt that noticeable and it doesnt really help with the quality this isnt a camera youre going to use for important  memorable moments but for things that most people use  like facebook  twitter  and instagram  it works great this is especially true for the front facing camera  with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details  provided there is good amount of light software this is basically running a close to stock version of android lollipop it is running version     with a stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks there are a few changes to the software for instance  the icons look like similar to the iphone  which can be both a good and bad thing  depending on whether you love or hate that style other than that  everything works just like stock android except for one feature that im surprised isnt universal to all phones that is the fact that this phone is reversible it doesnt sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor  but it is a rather practical and underrated feature ive answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasnt until after i hung up that i realized the phone was upside down it sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant of course  if you dont like this for some reason there is always the option to turn it off overall  the light touch that alcatel added onto android hasnt hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed conclusion i wasnt expecting to get a high quality phone  especially after my experience with an old model that i cant even remember the name but alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device it does have some compromises  but alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great there is a couple of phones that compete in this range  but the biggest one is the moto g is this better yes and no for power users  i would still recommend the high end moto g because of the extra ram or even a oneplus one  which is on sale now for   but if it must be under    like for college students like me  this beats the   low end moto g due to the higher quality speakers  display  nfc  and the slightly more ram this phone helps to answer the question do people really need to spend over   on a phone to get a high quality experience the answer for most people is no they dont there is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and dslr like quality cameras but for the rest of us  there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price  but just overall if you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like i was  let me help you go for this phone and you wont be disappointed,300,218,Positive,4.137614678899083,9150,1656

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,292.98,3,update november    i have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated november      this update kills the functionality of the tap to wake feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up this is a wonderful feature that i loved on this phone but this feature was largely killed with the november   update it now only works maybe   of the time i tap the screen to wake it this is a really obnoxious killing of a great feature if alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and i would not buy an alcatel product in the future because of this i dont particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug they sent an update patch that changed something i dont want changed thats a screw up and im not happygood phone  okay camerai got this for my wife to replace the galaxy s  we bought a few months ago turns out that phone was just too darn big the idol      version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal persons handthis is a nice phone in general its a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value with the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the smartphone industry  forcing the major players to bring pricing down i said the same thing about the    version of the idol   a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the asus zenfone   are enjoying in this price range  i am convinced youll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next   yearsthe good the sound   the front facing jbl speakers make this a solid rival to the htc one m  if you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you the sound is vibrant and most importantly its loud and its clear sound it doesnt sound like a tiny cell phone speaker it sounds like a real speaker the htc one product line made the front facing speakers its calling card and no one really challenged the htc design until now the alcatel onetouch idol   stands toe to toe with the htc one sound and doesnt flinch it physically looks like a nice phone  not a cheap off brand its not the most powerful processor in a smartphone  and its a little lower powered than the    variant but its plenty good enough to drive the idol   for normal daily use i didnt find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag it has expandable storage exclamation  thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone i hate the cloud i want to have my files on my device the idol   starts at  gb on board not all usable as the system takes up some of that but its expandable up to  gb via the tried and true sd card method so you can expand the storage significantly for     meanwhile some of the higher end smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the idol   to increase from a  gb base model to a  gb model the hd    display is very nice the colors are vibrant they may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors  but it works photos look richer  even if you dont get true life coloring all the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth meaning stuff like your icons and games and the ui interface  etc etc the resolution is a little lower than the    version  but the screen is also smaller so its not very noticeable this phone sas the same resolution as the   inch hdtv in my bedroom the back is flat exclamation  i like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something with a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying the idol   has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesnt wobble when you touch it this is such a simple thing but its huge for me its super thin see my picture with comparison next to my finger its thinner than my galaxy s   with just a slightly smaller screen its significantly smaller than screen on the galaxy s  we sold and its very light weight the camera was an initial area of concern for me everything looked over exposed and blurry this was largely fixed with an alternate camera app more on that later its still not the greatest camera in the world  but i have to factor in the price tag on the phone for   its a good enough camera in high light outdoors in day time its actually pretty decent in low light anytime you need the flash its not so hotthe bad the stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects you can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings  but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app it doesnt save them on the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue this almost caused me to return the phone  making me think the camera itself was bad plan on using an alternate camera app i switched to camera mx for photos available on amazon  but newer versions on google play camera mx has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesnt work the stock camera app works okay for video the battery is not replaceable they do wear out after a while and i like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires as controllers for things  mp  jukeboxes  etc i like being able to go on amazon  spend   on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out additionally  even if you dont keep your phones that long  batteries fail sometimes so no replaceable battery is a problem for me this might not be an issue for you if not  great exclamation  but be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions i sucked it up on this one because its my wifes phone and she didnt care but i dont love this industry trendthe bottom line it easily outperforms its   purchase price its not the greatest smartphone of all time  but you cannot beat this phone for   i said the same thing about the    versions   price the    isnt as good of a phone overall as the    which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs  but for   the    version is a great value  even with the camera not being an industry leader ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you if you never use the camera or dont use it for anything you want to keep  like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked  its a great smartphone i love the form factor of it its thinness its weight its display its all very nice use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure an alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone i had this as a   star review until i had better luck with different apps i also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that its a great value you can get a better camera on a phone  but it will cost more to do it for   you really cant go wrong,1150,218,Neutral,4.137614678899083,7291,1360

works great at bodega bay so we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for yearsi upgraded my text system to the mysms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friendsi added camera mx for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the mysms as noted above the system works seamlessly with amazon prime photos take a picture in a short time it is on amazon prime  and i can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds i have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of camera mx  and it surpasses any phone camera or camera i have had in over a decadethe battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my android tablet  chromebook with the mysyms connectionso this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything i need or want with the phone  internet connection and camera  g lte exclamation the cost of this is about  the first part of the below is for tracfone customersusers if you dont use tracfone  go below the dotted line for my reviewfor a week  my new alcatel idol       didnt work with my transferred tracfone minutes and years of use the tracfone site showed that my byop transfer had worked with my new byop sim card  and all of my minutes  data and time left were transferred the phone didnt work to makereceive calls or textsalcatel was of no help a friend suggested that i email tracfone to set up a phone call with them i did and got online  with someone as per the email from them he claimed they didnt have any of my data including tracfone phone  and id s fortunately  i had made a hard copy of what i had re time and years on my old smartphone and what tracfone showed with my new sim cardi told him that i needed to speak with someone  who could help me then on hold for   minutes  when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data i had emailed and told the other phone person after  i re told her the specific data  reading from my hard copy made the day the byop was supposedly activated then  she said i didnt have anytime left on my contract  and i need to buy more time i reminded her of the hard data showing over   minutes and time of agreement for years to come that was a   minute  call processshe said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor she did  and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call i said that i had sent all of that in via email  and i had given that data twice on the same phone call she found my contract and said my phone wasnt    working because my timeminutesdata hadnt been transferred she did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and i dialed in the code to activate itit now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff   times with tracfone on line people                                                                                                                                                                                                            evaluation of this phone is now   starsbefore  i got my tracfone problem corrected  i had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts  pictures and apps from my old android lg phone most of this went well the transfer of stuff from a nearby or close android acer tablet  old android phone and my acer chromebook    which im using for this report  didnt workthe wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wifes alcatel one touch android where i use it at home  the wifi reception is strong and very fastthe    screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was addedthe screen size is adequate for what i want to do away from home  to makereceive phone calls and textreceive and check texts and emails i will use my acer   tablet or my chromebook for more involved keyboardscreen work at homethe battery  so far is adequate so far for my uses last night it was   charge  and i didnt charge it this morning it was still   charged and again at   pm this afternoon when  i picked it up again and turned it on it was still at   bloatware is at a minimumit accepted my   gig card with no fussthe android    seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous  it works smoothly with my sms which i have on my tablet and chromebookalso  when you receive a phone call  you dont push or make contact directly with the phone icon you have slide that icon to the right to answer i have had cell phones since the  s  and that is differentsince the phone is now working with tracfone  i have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than beforethe glass add on screen i bought is too big the standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage i will try to find an aftermarket glass that fitsthe combo hard case and belt case extra buy is a mixed picture the hard case fits fairly wellhowever if you attach that to the other half of the hard case  you cant really get the camera out to make phone calls  receive them or to take a picture you have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case i missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone also  i didnt get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemif you use tracfone byop  and your phone doesnt work dont waste your time contacting alcatel send tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isnt working tracfone will send you an email with a phone and a numeric code to use when you  make that call  sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available  all of your data available  a bottle of water  a lot of patience  and your well charged alcatel idol   i used my acer chromebook to help with the data  the lost data and other stuff they neededin this short time  i think that alcatel and tracfone have a good winning combo if you use tracfones byop  and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time  be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data you will probably need that data

standby it holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unpluggedre wifi connections it quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly its wifi range in our house isnt as good as my wifes alcatel one touch popup  which is incredible re its wifi range however  since i never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas  that is not an issue the auto switch from wifi to tracfone  g lte like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless so far the tracfoneatt  g lte in our area is very strong and reliable hopeoufully  we can try the att  g lte inon our coastal areas where our verizontrackfone coverage is zerothe android   seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the android  s,10,218,Positive,4.137614678899083,7443,1316

variety of tips  and multi language manuallet me start this review by stating that ive had cell phones for nearly   years i always tend to go middle of the road with my phone models  keep them     years  then get a new one no flagships  but no junk  either ive had lg  samsung  moto  etc most of the big players in the american market ive never had an iphone i mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones was formedwhen i was shopping for a phone  i just happened across this one i had heard of alcatel before  but never really considered any of their phones the reviews of this particular model all seemed favorable  and at this price point it seemed like a really solid choice i wont re hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet  but ill touch on some things that ive noted and likeddislikedfirst impression of the phone it has a very nice look about it its very thin and very light in the hand the whole face of the unit is glass  and the sides are chromed plastic that give a pretty high quality look  overall no complaintsthe phone comes with a surprisingly nice set of jbl in ear headphones with mic and controller i dont personally like this style of earbuds  but i did try them out and was definitely pleased with the sound quality of music  videos  and phone callsafter inserting my sim and sd cards  and charging up for a bit  i turned on the unit it walked me through a pretty standard set up routine  then i let it update android  and put my usual apps on it after a bit of personalization and sorting out un used apps  this thing was ready to go all the while  i noticed how nice the screen was and how apps popped open quickly  and just the overall positive impression the phone gave memy observations to me the most important thing with a cell phone is its ability to function like a phone it seems weird to feel the need to state this  but i bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w their cell phones i have t mobile  and while i generally dont have reception issues  my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood in my house  i would often have to use my wi fi to make calls the alcatel works better than any other phone ive tried it never dropped calls  crystal clear reception and people that ive talked to said it sounded like my calls were as clear as a landline the speakers on the alcatel are really quite good  considering the size music sounds really nice on the speakers  and the output to headphones is above average i like that there are   speakers  one at either end of the phone gives a bit of stereo effect if youre watching a video the picture quality of the screen is quite nicer than i expected colors are good  images seem decently sharp not as nice as a galaxy  or iphone  but look at the price difference i watched a bunch of netflix  youtube  etc and i was really impressed overall i found the size of the unit to be almost perfect for me i actually am a very tall guy  big hands  etc and you would think that id like a bigger phone  but honestly  i like to be able to put the phone in my pocket  or be able to access all of the functions with one hand overall  its just convenient for me to have this size i really wish that phone manufacturers would settle down with making ever larger phones and make some quality ones in this size the battery life is very good i am not exactly a heavy user but i do make calls  check emails  check twitter  and watch the occasional vid i dont really do games  aside from the occasional solitaire i leave the wifi and gps on    i easily got over a day before needing to charge if i had particularly light usage during a day and didnt watch any video  i could go nearly   hours before needing to plug in i am not any kind of expert on androids different iterations i dont tweak my phones  or run different roms or anything like that i can say that this phones os skin whatever didnt bug me it just worked no complaints seemed like standard android fare that im used to  and nothing raised any flags for me just a decent system with things doing what i expected them to do the cameras  both front and back  are pretty good  i think i take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies  but not for portraits or anything like that  more record keeping my requirements are pretty low i can say that with good lighting  the rear camera took very nice pictures if youre used to phones in this price range  the cameras are going to seem pretty normal nothing bad to report  just a solid cameraas for what i didnt like about the phone this is very subjective  and not really a big deal actually its bordering on silly of me  if im being honest the power button was on the left side andthe volume rocker was on the right this is opposite of every other phone ive had i was constantly turning the phone off when i had been intending to change the volume as i said  not a big deal  but just something i thought id mentionand now for why i rated this   stars the astute reader will note that most of this is written in the past tense i have returned the phone as much as i like nearly everything about this phone  i experienced a deal breaking problem with two of thesemy first phone had a stuck pixel in the lower right section of the screen when viewing lighter colors on the screen  it wasnt terribly noticeable but when viewing darker materials or movies  or whatever  it really stuck out i guess im pretty lucky in that ive never had a phone with any kind of problems  but im realistic i know problems slip through the cracks sometimes i just figured it was my turn to get a bad one no big deal thank goodness for amazon prime  right so i sent it back  and ordered another one after a day or two of using the new phone  i noticed that the screen had a problem in roughly the same area as the other one  though it was a different problem lower right hand side of the screen when running my finger across the screen  id get a distortion in that spot like when you press a flatscreen too hard i wasnt pressing too hard  though no different than any other area of the screen while this defect was much less bothersome than the stuck pixel  it was still a problem  and i figured it would only get worse with time so  back it went while it was still under the return period for amazonso  overall  i cannot recommend this particular phone i really wanted to like it  but the fact that it had a screen problem on two of them in the same spot kind of spooked me off of it i will keep my eye on the alcatel idol series and may try it again someday  as i really was impressed with so many aspects of this phone,40,218,Negative,4.137614678899083,6960,1282

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,im not going to get into too many explicit specs on the phone because i am trying to review this from a real world  does it work perspective i dont care about benchmarks  i care about how i was able to use this phone in my everyday life if you want every technical detail  you can go herehardwarescreenthe idol is a    inch phone with a  p ips screen the back of the phone has a plastic back  but not removable so no battery swapping there are some faux chrome accents that go around the device and the speakers dual front facing  more on that later are at the very tippy top and bottom of the phone the phone feels pretty nice in the hand and wasnt hard to holdthe screen is fantastic and one of the best features of the phone alcatel uses some buzz words to describe it technicolor exclamation  but the simplest way to put it is that the screen is vivid  bright and crystal clear its not flagship level for    that would require a qhd screen  but what it lacks in resolution vs something like the lg g  or samsung galaxy s   it makes up for by being   cheaper off contract than any other flagship device simply put  the idols screen is so nice  it doesnt feel like it should be on a phone so cheapmy other favorite hardware feature is the inclusion of a mircosd slot next to the sim card slot which are both in a tray thats ejected from the left side of the phone i basically cant buy a phone without extra storage because i prefer to keep as much music downloaded to my phone as i can  to avoid streaming either due to data restrictions or having access to it when i am in areas with poor coverage the storage is up gradable to  gb  which goes on top of the  gb the phone offers out of the gate almost  gb usable out of the boxsound qualitythe quality of sound i get from a smartphone is critical to me id say i place listening to musicpodcasts as the number one use i have for a smartphone my htc one has audio tuned by beats  which then morphed into boomsound  but whatever you want to call it  it sounds great coming from the device or listening via headphonesim happy to say that the sound quality is another feature here that seems like it would come from a more expensive phone here  alcatel touts sound tuned by jbl with an option to turn that sound optimization on or off under the settings i much prefer the sound with the feature on and id say it easily rivaled my htc one for sound quality both when listening from the device or with headphonestheres a speaker on the top and bottom of the phone  which is  in part  necessary for their upside down feature basically  you can pick up the phone for a call and it will be properly orientated regardless of it being right side up or not i dont find the feature to be something that was of great use to me  but i can see the functionregardless of that feature  having two speakers on the phone is part of what makes it sound great some newer phones  like the asus zenfone   have what looks like dual front speakers  but in reality only one speaker is at the top or the bottom the idol gets loud when listening from the device louder than my one i love this feature because it makes for listening to music or podcasts in the shower nice and easy to hear the speakers dont even seem to become over burdened when at full volumesound quality is on par with the screen  giving the idol   features that feel to be of much better quality that youd expect from a phone in this price rangeusabilityandroid lollipop comes standard i think i had    out of the gate and is near stock most of the non stock features are removable ive grown to love stock android vs any skinned version of it  so that was a determining factor for me with the idolthe general  day to day use of the idol is perfectly adequate  but not overwhelmingly speedy this was the first part of the phone that felt like you get what you pay for thats not to say its not functional  because it very much so is where as i found the lack of speed to be a factor in selling my moto g  i had no such thoughts with the idolthere are no issues with multi tasking  i was easily able to switch between music  maps  a browser and a game things like that are just a bit pokey to respond not pokey in the sense that it takes   seconds of your life from you  but sometimes a program might take   or   seconds longer to open than youd see on a phone with a top of the line processorram setup those   to   seconds seem annoying sometimes  but that just speaks to me and my lack of patience the reality is that this phone works perfectly well and should for the vast majority of userscall quality is perfectly adequate  but i am probably not someone who should even speak to that i spend  maybe    minutes a week using my smartphone as an actual phone  but those   minutes work very well i come across clearly as does the person on the other end the speakerphone has the benefit of the dual speakers  just as a song or podcast doesi feel like the hardware buttons would have been nicer if placed a littler lower due to the phones size  i had issues with pressing the unlock button with one hand not massive issues  since ive almost always used two hands with my phone  but for people who like a one hand device  this might not be it if im being honest  i think this is a stupid reason to or not to buy a phone  i tend to just adapt to whatever device i select  but to each their own the usb port and headphone jack are where youd expect them  on the bottom and top  respectivelybattery lifeanother nice feature with the phone is battery life i dont consider myself a super heavy user of screen time on a basic day  so id easily get home with   after work and make it to bed with   or more having the phone on a recent vacation where i was heavy on camera use and gps i found myself slightly more nervous with battery life  but the phone charges very quickly   in   minutes  i think so driving   minutes from one place to another  i could give a quick boost and take that nervousness away overall  very solid battery life for my and i think most peoples usagecamerahere we get a  mp rear facing camera with a  mp front facing camera for selfies all in all  i was very happy with the camera performance in well lit situations  shots where clear and crisp some low light situations mad for poorer quality pictures  but thats every camera phone  ever the biggest struggle for the camera was actually on a cloudy day i used the cameras time lapse video function to film a boat trip i took on lake superior and you can see that the phone struggles with its focus and makes the land look rather dark against the cloudy sky this could be user error  however  im not surelike every other smartphone out there  theres an hdr function in the menu to give a little more definition to your shots i think it worked as well as one would expect  but i stuck with the cameras auto mode for the most part check out this gallery here  here and here to see some shots in all sorts of lighting conditionsother than having the sun blare straight into the camera lens or overly dark shots  i really liked what the camera gave me anything i see as a negative with the camera is just the reality of using a smartphone for your main camera due to convenience they are never going to perform like the best point and shoot units  but to have decent performance is nice and the idol is a step or two above decentfinal verdicti dont think you can get this much phone for the money you pay  anywhere else the idol is  very easily  worth the extra   youd be spending over a moto g the other phone that was hot in the running for me was the asus zenfone    gb ram version but i picked the idol for its superior sound quality and screen  both of which i think are better than the asus i know that oneplus has their  s at a lower cost right now  but the lack of a mirco sd card took them out of the running for me  i keep a lot of music on my phoneoverall  there is a trade off between these less expensive  off contract phones oneplus and asus focused on making a very responsive  powerful phone and alcatel focused on a better media experience i dont think you can go wrong with any of those three options  but the idol onetouch   was easily the phone for meand i miss it as i alluded to earlier  i am back to my htc one i got a little to into my desire to become ansel adams that i may or may not have dropped the idol in a river in northern wisconsin id love to get another idol  but its not currently in the budget and i do have a phone that works  even if i cant update it i plan to wait out until next year to see what the onetouch   will bring alcatel made a statement with this device and i hope to see them continue making phones at a budget price with specs and usability that outweigh the budget price

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,4,just to be upfront i got this as a backup phone for my family to share for just in case moments i got it on a pre order one day sale of     and couldnt pass up a good deal like that that being said  so far im pretty impressed doesnt have the best camera  but honestly its not really that bad at all especially at the price i paid im really appreciating the fact that the interface is simple and not cluttered the settings menu is very easy to navigate  meaning it doesnt contain a bunch of crapware that no one uses or have an over done settings menu poor overall user experience  unwantedunremovable carrier and oem software  and overdone menus are contributing to dissatisfaction and to decline for some of the bigger manufacturers  but they just dont get itthe reversible phone screen features a cool little item also comes in handy when answering the phone and allows you to have your headphone jack facing the direction you want the screen is surprisingly bright  crisp  and device seems very responsive and runs pretty smooth so far it doesnt have all the power that my familys main phones have  but in real life use  its powerful enough and seems to handle everything fairly well some little nitpicky things i dont like  and this is just me  and this is on any non pure android phone  i dont like ampm showing on the lock screen  it just looks off centered i also dont like ampm showing in the status bar its unnecessy visual clutter your common sense clues you in on the ampm status of the day and google nexus is the only one that gets that maybe at least an option to hide it dont like where the power or volume keys are placed  as i said earlier the camera is not the best  but for the most part its actually not bad i use googles camera and edit it with google photos and the pictures come out pretty decentonce encrypted you have no choice but to listen to the boot up sound not once  but twice yay exclamation  great for when you turn your phone on in a quiet setting everyone around you is sure to appreciate the jingle and think happy thoughts i dont know why oem manufacturers think we need to hear boot up sounds and jingles decisions like this make owning a nexus a must for me all androids have weak and strong points  but not including the nexus  most of them have a lot more dumb oem annoyances that you have to deal with  but i digress one of many of the biggest secrets to the success of the iphone  just one start putting unnecessary apps from the carrier and stupid bleeps and bloops  startup sounds  etc on the iphone and i guarantee you the complaints would come in droves could you imagine verizon  att or other carriers forcing apps and software on the iphone that you couldnt remove it would totally hurt apples sales and people would be in the streets with pitchforks  torches and knives im digressing againalso  the aosp keyboard is not the same as the google keyboard  at least mine isnt looks exactly the same  but the swype like slide to text feature wont work for me even though i have it set properly in settings to do so had to actually install googles real keyboard from the play store obviously a bug not a big deal  but worth notingbesides  having googles keyboard or any keyboard from the store also means it will get updated as needed from the actual store that wont ever happen with most aosp keyboards or oem keyboard unless you get a system update my keyboard having this glitch is a perfect example it wont get fixed anytime sooni do like the overall look of the device it looks fairly thin and is very light i ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a simple tpu case for it i do like the expandable storage  i really like the small bezels  i like that it doesnt have any unnecessary branding on the front of the phone  i like its simplicity  i like that its not overdone in the software department  i like the price i paid  although   is still a good deal really like the front facing speakers and sound i like the double knock to turn on  which is necessary since the power button is awkward to press im also impressed that the volume button presses adjust to the orientation of the screen so volume up is always up  and down is down  regardless of orientation the battery life is surprisingly good  and the camera is actually a bit better than i thought it would be and is more than adequate for basic use nice that they threw in hdr with iti guess the only things im not gung ho about is the cluttery ampm as i overly mentioned  and the other items it also charges very quickly using its own charger and cord i used a samsung plug on it  but it just got really warm and would barely charge  so it may be biased to its own chargers im not sure how fast it would charge speed wise with an lg  htc  motorola etc  or just a generic usb plugin anyways the charger and plug in that it comes with appear to be very good quality even my teenage daughter who is always interested in the latest and greatest android phones  thinks its a pretty decent phone and thats saying a lot to her at least its not ugly looking she actually likes the icon and ui look over her galaxy which is kind of fixed on samsung by using nova launcher she definitely likes that it doesnt have a bunch of applications that she has to turn off or hide  and you can actually uninstall ones you dont want thats pretty crazy in android world user menu is so much easier to navigate than on her samsung shes not excited about the camera though if it had the same camera and screen as the gs    i think she would possibly swap for it  im not expecting them to update this phone in the future  although i hope that they do i may even consider using this as a daily driver if that happens it would be great to see this get future lollipop updates or get updated to android moverall this is a really great phone  especially for someone on a budget or someone who wants a decent android phone that isnt going to turn them off of android like most low in android phones will  sending you into the arms of an iphone in a heartbeat even if youre not on a budget  this still is a definte keeper if alcatel keeps producing phones like this  theyll be giving the high end phone market a run for their money,90,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,6343,1161

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,i felt like i should write a review on this as a average phone useri am a tech guy and have worked in it for over   years  but i dont have to have the best of the new phones i use mine for mail constantly  browsing   or so times a day  usually just to look something up quickly at home facebook at night a few times maybe  every once in a while games  but usually just basic stuff like spades or backgammon  every once in awhile some better game maybe   texts a month on averageon to the phone  keep in mind i am coming from a razr mi ordered   of these to replace to razr ms on verizon and we were switching over to cricket wireless so perfect time for this phone to releasesetup   super easy  turned on the phone  picked my language  setup my wireless connection  and it let me know there was a  mb update took like   seconds to download it and then it installed and rebooted it then prompted me to setup or transfer my account  i figured hey transfer it  it told me to put my old phone back to back and seconds later my account had transferred overthe screen is huge compared to what i am used to  and very bright  i have it on auto adjust but its usually around   brightness  it is so brighti dont use my phone while walking to text or do facebook etc but i have checked notifications outside  no problems reading in sunlight colors look fine to me  at least for what i needaudio is pretty loud  the dual stereo speakers are more than what i would expect out of my phoneif i want to share a youtube video with someone we both have no problems hearing it playweb browsing  i have had no real problems or lag as some others seem to have had  but i do limit what i browse to on my phone  i dont go to some of the sites that have tons of ads etc on my phone i have no problems with slickdeals or dealnews like some people have mentionedwi fi speed is awesome on mine  i am on  g in my house and its so much faster than my old phone or my laptops its actually just as fast as my main rig on a wired connection every test i have run is over  mb down and  mb up and i am on a    plan for me its very fast as tested by ookla on multiple serversdata speed  i dont use much as i am on wireless at home and at work  but i have had  glte everywhere i have checked it and i am in northern idaho which doesnt have near the same coverage as say seattlei havent had any problems with any apps installing or crashingactually i have several apps that seem to work a lot betterfitbit  and yamaha av controller for example work so much better and quickerbluetooth is great  synced to my car easier than my last   phones did  has extra security on trusted devices for both bluetooth and wi fi devicessupports usb and wi fi tethering  both of which i will probably never usei have a  gb sd card in mine and the limited access i have used it for has been finereversible mode works and is neat to show people  but i like most people will usually pick up my phone the right way  but it makes handing your phone to someone else easier if you want to show them somethingtap to wake   this is discussed a lot  works fine every time for sleep  but it does seem like some app installs make it wonky if i go back into gestures and turn it off and then turn it back on it seems to fix the problemnot all apps break it  but i have had it happen twice nowi dont have a problem with the power button on the left  fine by me  better than on the top like some phonesincluded apps dont bother me at all  and lollipop seems to run fine on my phonesome people have had problems etc but anyone who has been around tech knows  all companies  all products  ship bad batchesphone is very light but i am getting used to it already  i have it in a case which has made it not seem so fragile anymoreoverall i really like the phone and for   pre ordered i am more than happy plus i used turbo tax this year so bonus amazon gift cards paid for mineas for the camera  i havent used it yet  i take pictures on family outings etc but havent had the chance yetplus if i know i am going somewhere i will want to take pictures ahead of time i am going to take my dslri honestly dont care what the camera is like on my phone to be honest  but the little i have seen will be fine for my needsi paid more for each of my lenses on my dslr then i did for this phone  so what do i expect rightthere are some other things i could talk about  but that is the gist of what i am going to use the phone forupdate   am    took it off the charger      pm      left on the battery after   days of use  several phone calls and   trips in the car synced to the caralso should note you can go into the specifics of the battery and view wi fi and network strength as well as screen on time for the entire time broken down by the hour since last chargedat this rate i could make it almost   more days before running out of batteryalso should note i have the notification led off and the notification tone set to only go off once when something comes inupdate    i took my wifes off the charger    and she has used it mildly since then she has been home a few of the days  but still uses it everyday a little as of    last night phone was at   pretty dang good keep in mind my old razr m had to be charged halfway through the day at this point due to shortened battery life so being able to go for days is so nice i went   days on my last charge as well but i didnt make it to   like the wife didstill enjoying the phone  i still cannot believe how much better all my apps work on the new phone compared to on kitkatupdate    for those that were asking   days  just got upgraded to     today on the firmware so they are updating pretty well since its product launch time hasnt even been   months and they already have   updates plus dealing with all the bs from a product launch so overall i would say pretty goodstill love the phone  i would say the battery life is a little shorter than i first thought but i think its because it works so well i find myself using it a lot more than i used to use my old phonestill a

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,a very solid phone for the asking pricei was able to purchase this device during promotion for   dollar  but in this review i will compare to the mate    note   and nexus    iphone   which at the time of my purchase was   dollar    dollar    dollar and   dollar id like to mention that the asus zenfone   is a very capable phone and priced at     but i do not have a unit to compare withpro  build quality is superb the phone is assembled with high precision  the unit is very thin and very solid the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel it is very similar to the feeling of nexus    which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing  the speaker is superb it is up there with htc boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass htc may be better at treble at any rate the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables that includes ipad the true stereo speaker and high definition sound for a phone really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox and most importantly  this phones speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames so all the glory without htcs huge ugly speaker grills  screen is awesome it has one of the brightest screen on a phone no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle it easily rivals the screen found on iphone   in the realm of ips  this screen is as good as it goes but i still prefer the almoed on note   better for its deep contrast  stock andriod pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatels reversible screen which means very little overhead and smooth operation  support sd card while most say sd card is useless  i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage i often travel for business and leisure and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow i always keep the here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction  and thats a good   to  g of data all by itself and if one uses the phone to take photo or video  heshe will use few gig of storage in a week or two bottom line  after   month of using note    i have already exhausted the  g sd card and just moved to  g sd card and having sd card on a phone  even if you dont think you need it  is a big plus to meaverage  camera is very average for   flagship phone but very good for   standard the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is note    which was released in   but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review compared with note    the onetouch idol lacks resolution  white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition however  i would say that idol  does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago eg iphone   galaxy s  do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones  and this phone is very thin    mm compared with iphone  s    mm its optics will suffer even with a capable cmos sensor  performance again  this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago like htc m   s  or iphone   and might even be slightly faster which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email  browsing web or play games even the very intensive games like implosion you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge pdf file or some complicated websites  or a longer loading time for games  but not a deal breaker in my mind it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone  but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways  reception in the same location  this phones reported reception is always about   to   dbm lower than the note   which would technically translate to   of signal strength since the highest is probably    dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around     compromises with such wonderful design and display  there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price for one thing you dont have    ac  you dont have magnetometer or a gyroscope  all of which zenfone   has for similar and cheaper msrp   while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction i do not miss the    ac feature the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers  but this is completely useless because the phones internal storage is so slow that it doesnt matter how fast you can pull down the data at least on my note    the transfer rate doesnt seem to have any difference when running ac or n  processor i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job but the   is just gimmicky technically with its octa core  it should be little big design that you have two cluster of computing units  one is fast but power hungry a a  while another a a  is slow but power efficient but in this device  you have   a  core  just one cluster is clocked faster really qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard  core a s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect in fact  qualcomm said themselves that   was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance id much rather see a   or intels core in this phone than   for the similar priceoverall  a very solid phone that actually have a good design it is one of those product that doesnt do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance while not perfect  it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at   usd this,30,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,6123,1125

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,4,i bought this phone after having used an iphone   for    years im no phone expert but i have owned several smart phones including the original samsung galaxy  and iphone    and the aforementioned iphone  the reason i chose this phone was the specs and the decent price i paid   with a   discount from amazon which reduced it to   for an unlocked phone that performs decently that is a good deal my thoughts about the phone belowthe good stuff the phone itself feels solid i like the front facing speakers   they provide good sound the screen is good its bright and big and does what its supposed to do the back of the phone doesnt feel like plastic  although it probably is the fact that i still cant tell three weeks into it should tell you all you need to know about that the size of the phone was a bit daunting when i started using it iphone   is tiny compared to this phone but its grown on me i can finally read comfortably using a phone that means i use my tablet less finding apps is not a problem google apps seem to work just a little bit better on android  although that shouldnt be a surprise my wi fi connectivity works great  and the phone calls i make sound clearer than my old iphone the  glte connectivity seems to work better too although i cant prove itthe bad the phone is noticeably slow when starting apps the wait time to start apps is measured in seconds and its annoying if you buy this phone  buy the one with  gb ram one nice feature that really helps me is being able to shut down all open applications with one button click something the iphone never had another bad thing are the button locations the power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone at the same level so when i push the button to shut off the screen i end up squeezing both sides of the phone which takes a screen shot i cant even tell you how many screen shots ive mistakenly taken not a huge deal  but again  annoying i dont particularly like where android puts all its system settings  but thats a personal nit since im still acclimating to the androidbottom line its a good unlocked phone at an affordable price id recommend it with the caveats i mentioned,20,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,2239,412

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,throughout my lifetime  the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises smartphones have been an exception  largely because of the subsidy model  and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to   that puts this alcatel onetouch clearly in the budget category  despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized televisionthese days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model  and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable alcatel has changed that with this phone while it wont compete with the latest high end models on todays market  it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago this unlocked phone is technically a non locked phone its not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want an important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility this phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as att or t mobile or any other that uses a sim  and that includes  g and lte bandsit gives you  gb of memory  with about  gb available for user content it also supports a microsd card  for up to  gb more it takes a micro sim  which is fairly standard these days it gives you a fast octa core qualcomm snapdragon   processor  which i found responsive i havent tested it with video games that are extremely cpu or graphically intensive  but for typical tasks there should be no lag you get very good sound for built in speakers  and the phone works just as well when you flip it over  even for phone callsthe cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone  and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago but you dont get any special frills or controls for exposure you get a good  mp camera and an  mp front facing camera  both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones  and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos for low light situations  you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices you also get  p video one of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video on other cameras  it will switch you to video mode  but why all that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button  which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos with this phone  the video button is in a logical place for landscape video  theres no reason to switch modes  and your shutter button still works for still photos that way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes  and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videosi havent torture tested it  but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones the phone itself doesnt have the look or feel of a cheap phone phone screens have been growing larger  and this one gives you a    inch screen personally i could make do with a smaller screen  but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and alcatel is no exceptiona few things i dont like about the phone are that the battery isnt removable that might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good i also dont like the offset usb connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car this is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as samsung or apple the other thing thats apparently missing is wifi calling for t mobile google now has a hangouts dialer  which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller id not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaroundother issues have to do with support the phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone specific support information on its website  but its still not there this phone doesnt show up on the list on the support page that means there are no downloads or phone specific faqs the phone comes with a quick start guide  but no user manual and theres none on the websiteupdate there is still no link to a user manual on their website  but customer service was able to send me a url for one there are some features that need further explanation and i was hoping that the user manual would cover them for example  the status led doesnt work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything the phone has a setting to turn it on or off youd expect the manual to tell you what the led indicates  but all the manual says about that setting is touch to turn onoff the led indicator if you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works  the manual says touch to enable time lapse when describing the setting  but thats already obviousoverall  you get a lot for your money it may not be the highest end phone out there  but the big companies better look over their shoulders it beats what they offer at this price point and i wouldnt be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competitions top of the line in the near future,1250,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,5405,961

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,hello exclamation  after around   full months of owning this phone  id like to share my   centsi bought this back in october and i am an att costumer it was a simple process of transferring my sim card form my previous much older smartphone to this new alcatel idol   i had bought a  gb memory card to go along with it and again  the installation was super simple and really easy both the sim and memory card sit side by side like buddies in a tray that pops in and out of the phone using a thin wire    such as a paperclipanyway  down to the phone itself i love it it has met and exceeded my needs and ive used it a lot in these six months like a lot a lot everyday for a few hours at least i do everything from playing games on it  surfing the web  playing videos lots of youtube exclamation   playing music  reading articles  and of course  calling and texting    because its a phonehere is what i absolutely love about this phone  the screen oh boy the screen this thing has a beautiful  incredibly bright screen i actually have it on the lowest brightness setting  because anything higher than that it is too bright haha its really a gorgeous screen full hd   ppi looks great again  can get very bright  the ram and processor the combination of these two have met my needs with hardly any problems ive had multiple  high demanding apps running in the background games  youtube  torrent clients and the phone does well to keep up with what i throw at it it does slow down eventually and can appear like its struggling  but i can imagine thatd be the case with any device after meeting its threshold  the speakers exclamation  i dont use them much  but man oh man when i do  theyre a joy this phone has excellent front facing speakers that really do fill a room i use this phone for my alarm and every morning hearing this thing blast away some beautiful sounding tunes is a real treat to wake up to  build quality this is not only a nice looking phone  but if feels well built and constructed quite a bit nicer than the price tag would hint at i was  and am  thoroughly impressed with it ive managed to take good care of it  so theres no noticeable scratches on both the backside and the screen and none have randomly appeared  the battery exclamation  oh jeez so when i say that i use this phone a lot i sure mean it  and this battery holds up really well on the way to work  at work  and upon arriving back at home i am usually left with a good chunk of battery life        it very rarely dips below   on a given day  which is freakin awesomethings i like about it  but could be better  its thin and lightweight i was super surprised by how thin and light it was and actually very nervous about handling it however  upon buying and putting on a decent size case which added a little bulk to it  the phone size is just about perfect but i wouldnt mind it being a bit heavier and maybe a touch thicker  just so if i did end up dropping it i wouldnt feel like it would explode  the camera this takes a bit of trial and error  such as finding an appropriate app that will utilize the camera to its fullest the camera is not oh wow exclamation  look at that exclamation  great when i first used it i had to get accustomed to where and how it worked best for example  its not great in low light environments taking a picture at night uh  forget about it its rough times but in daytime  with lots going on and lots of things to focus on  the camera does surprisingly well and can    on occasion    take some truly spectacular pictures but those times are few and far between so id recommend finding a different phone if you really want a nice camera on a phone  but for the most part this guy does the trick    just be a bit prepared for figuring out its limitations also  the front facing selfie camera is surprisingly nice exclamation  the few selfies ive taken have turned out better than id like to admit exclamation   the pre installed launcher eh  its not great  but its not terrible it can get sluggish and doesnt look the best there are other options out there that are far better also  many of the pre installed apps sort of fall into the same boat theyre not great  but theyre not terrible i really wish the file managed was better though  because it seems to be the only app that you can voluntarily copy and move files between the internal storage and the micro sd card ugh  i think that might be an android issue though  sound quality  internal audio ampdriver now  i aint no audiophile or anything like that  but i do appreciate a nice sounding device paired with a nice set of earphones this phone  similar to its camera  gets the job done  but again there isnt that wow exclamation  listen to this exclamation  feeling i wasnt buying the phone for its audio capabilities    internal audio driver    but with its awesome external speakers and its partnership somewhat with jbl i have to say that i was expecting more ive used a number of apps with different audio files  but ive owned past devices that have sounded significantly better anyway  its no deal breaker  but it is a thing and if youre looking for a device with great sound quality  id look elsewhereoverall  i am super happy with this phone i bought it back when it was    and i am shocked it has dropped down to   its a steal at that price it really is its no flagship  iphone destroyer  but it gets the job done with battery to spare exclamation  i really do like it and i think if youre an att costumer looking for a new smartphone for a smart price  then this is it everything ive asked it to do    both usual and ughunusual hahah    it has executed wellif you do end up getting it  here are a few parting recommendations  purchase a  gb micro sd card theyre cheap  awesome  and easy to install  get a case exclamation  it makes the phone a bit bigger and easier to handle i dont like screen protectors  so i cant speak about those  look into finding a camera app for the phone i bought one on google playstore called cameringoeffects and i really like it just make sure to set it to hd pictures itll seem like it has a smaller viewing screen  but the quality of the photos are a ton better than the default picture quality on the app  look into finding a different launcher for the phone i got nova launcher prime and it makes the phones interface speedier and more user friendly  and you can customize it off the wazooalright  well thats my   cents on this phone overall  i think its great and at    its quite the stealio,20,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,6533,1204

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,4,after using the phone as my daily driver for a month i can honestly say this is one of the best experiences you can have off a budget smart phone i use the term budget for the description of the price range however the experience is that of a flagship phone in this review i will talk about the design  hardware  usability  and daily experience of the phonedesignits not secret that at this price range you are going to get a plastic phone with that aside its one of the nicest builds it have a solid but light feel in the hand the back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully lastly the phone is completely symmetrical the top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo sensor and there is a reason for it ill explain more in the experience sectionhardwaredespite the price this prince is running a snapdragon   octa core with   cores at   ghz and the other   at   ghz and  gb of ram it has wifi with  ghz band and   ghz support i can say that the wifi works well and has great range helps if you have a good router as well lte is band   capable for those who will be using t mobile the rear facing camera is a   megapixel sony sensor with a   megapixel front facing camera but shoot at    aspect ratio if you want    hd photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to    mega pixel and    on the front camera the display is a bright and beautiful    inch ips hd display running at  x p with   pixels per inch and to tight everything together are jbl powered stereo speakers with   microphones one on top and bottom of the phone all that powered by a  mah batteryusabilityi had a motorola x   which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what ok google can do after having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that going from a    inch display to a    inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use i have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible the stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the lg g  or i phone   plus for that matter the phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my moto x having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing the sound was rich and crystal clear  with good highs and mids  low lows but still better than any other phone out there the photo sensor works really well with its software the screen always had the right amount of brightness  never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem the front facing camera is just a dream with selfies not that i do much but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming hd and close to  fps on a good internet connection the display also runs at  fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring softwareexperiencethe as a whole runs pretty smooth about   of the time there are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only   sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy s  or i phone   plus once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag the home screen  multi task bar  and quick setting menu from the top are lag free honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying   for a phone the delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships i actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior the phone is running a stock    android experience with an icon pack install with the acatel launcher i actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look not a fan of the bright looking icons on the acatel launcher the camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop the image processing is horrible i installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options after all this the batter is a big plus its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge i was able to get    hrs of on screen time watching netflix through wifi when power using during the day i got     hrs of on screen time over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new  this is it there is nothing that compares with it,60,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,5264,975

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,3,ive had this phone for a couple of days now i wanted something with a bigger screen  but without having to spend the eight or nine hundred bucks it would have cost to stay in the iphone family my overall cost for this phone and a   gb microsd card was about    the cost of an iphone  s plusgetting the phone set up was mostly simplei checked for and installed the android system updates while charging the phone  then put in the microsd and sim cards the sim card was kind of a pain  since an adapter was necessary  but once i discovered that the adapter i ordered did include a thin strip of tape to make sure the sim card doesnt fall out which was not mentioned anywhere on the package  all went smoothlythe parts i like  so far the expandable storagememory i may replace the   gb card with a   gb card at some point  but itll be more than enough for now im just happy to no longer be limited to the phones built in storage the large screen and full hd   x   resolution text is very readable  even at the normal setting  and theres plenty of room for whatever im looking at images generally look sharp and smooth  without jagginess the double tap feature double tap to wake the phone  then double tap to put it to sleep again very convenientespecially given the phones reversible feature caveat it does not work with the lock screen in that instance  the power button has to be used to put the phone back to sleep the reversible feature im surprised more phones dont do this when the feature is enabled  the display orients itself to the way you are holding the phone not only that  but the earpiece and microphones switch as well  so the phone is always right side up  even when holding it upside down the battery life so far  the battery life seems very good the phone did charge a little bit between the time i transferred some photos to my computer and the time i unplugged the usb cable otherwise  the battery is currently at   since its first full charge two nights ago the sweep feature or whatever it is called  which enables you to close all open apps at once very convenient the phone is light despite being significantly larger than my old iphone   the display on this phone by itself is bigger than the iphone   in a case  the idol   is lighter than the iphone   i dont think its a huge difference  but its definitely enough to notice the stereo speakers the speakers sound goodand they sound just as good whether the phone is facing up or down even in the simple case i bought for it the unlocked phone is upgradable to marshmallow     my carrier offers the idol    but theres no indication of the marshmallow upgrade being available from them anytime soon otherwise  i would have gone through themthere are a couple of things im not so keen on at the moment the placement of the buttons though on opposite sides  the power and volume buttons are placed at about the same level i have already taken several inadvertent screenshots while trying to put the phone to sleep from the lock screen the camera it may be a matter of getting used to it  but the camera does not appear to live up to the quality of the display colors seem a bit washed out  especially with the front camera also  the front camera offers only automatic exposure  whereas the back camera offers full manual update     the manual mode is useless you can adjust iso  shutter speed  and focus  exclamation   but all youll get is a black imageyup  no picture whatsoever only the automatic exposure mode will work in addition  the panoramic mode does a poor job you will end up with jagged edges at the least  and probably even sections where the image is not stitched together properly in any event  in all but the best lighting conditions  your images will be noisy  with some blockiness apparent  and plenty of chroma noise if you already have a phone that takes decent photos  youll want to hang onto it either that  or use a real camera if you use a pin to unlock your phone  android requires you to press a check key after the number not a huge deal  but ios unlocks the phone as soon as youve pressed that last digit  so i sometimes forget  and the phone goes back to sleep unlike the iphone  this phone doesnt read the sim card until after the rather lengthy splash screen animation has finished so  whereas the iphone will show the name of the carrier and signal strength as soon as youve unlocked the phone  the idol   shows no sim card  and then no sim card  [carrier] before the name of the carrier appears this always gives me pause  particularly since i have a nano sim and had to use an adapter also unlike the iphone  the display does not show the name of the carrier all the timebut that can be easily verified in the quick setting panel i mean  i know who my carrier is i just like to know that the telephony function of the phone is working properlyas for the quality of phone calls  i havent used it long enough  but the first call i made sounded okay at this point  i would probably give the iphone a slight edge in sound qualityi havent tried the earbuds yet  but then i rarely use my phone to listen to music  so this isnt much of a concern for mea note about the packaging because theyve hidden it under the lid covering the compartments of the box that contain the usb cable  charger  and earbuds  the tool used to open the card holder is very easy to miss i had already used the one that came with the sim card adapter i bought at the same time as the phone when i finally noticed it was thereapart from a few hiccups that go with getting used to a new os  i am liking the idol   so far its a light phone with a great display  good sound  and good battery life  and i didnt have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get it,40,798,Neutral,4.045112781954887,5889,1079

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",ALCATEL,129.0,5,i lucked out and was able to buy the idol   for   shortly before midnight on amazons prime day blow out i gotta say  alcatel did an exceptional design job on the idol   i believe its the best value smartphone on the marketpros  superb screen easy to use in bright sunlight  which makes picture taking a breeze on a sunny day  jbl sound  through both the speakers and the headset  is outstanding the included jbl headphones are excellent with clear mids  highs and distortion free tight bass  the build quality on this phone is exceptional feels good in your hands  with no hint of cheapness  flimsiness  or low quality material buttons presses are firm and manufacturing seams are aligned and tight its also remarkably light and thin  before i got the phone i thought the reversible user interface ui was something that  although slick  i doubted id use very much on the contrary  being able to reverse the ui comes in pretty handy and i use it quite a lot for instance  sometimes its convenient to have headphones plugged into the top of the phone  and other times its better for me to have the cord coming out of the bottom like on my dashboard car mount with the reversible screen thats not an issue  i love the the double tap feature super convenient  particularly in the car however  it can occasionally be inconsistent see cons below  volume  power button placement a lot of reviewers dislike the placement of the vol and power buttons because theyre located high on the phones sides however  i actually prefer this button placement because a as im holding or carrying the phone  im not constantly hitting the buttons  and  b in my car  it allows me to put the phone in my dashboard car mount such that the mounts clamp is not pressing the buttons  call quality call quality is good i hear no distortion or tinny ness  overall processor performance im not a big time power user or gamer  so the idol   performs reliably and predictably for me occasionally i do experience a slight stutter  but its so minor that its no big deal navigation around the ui is generally smooth and hiccup free  camera picture quality stacks up nicely with other phones  some which cost a lot more for all but the most demanding needs  the idol   will deliver crisp  focused shots with good color balance i have not used it much in low light  so i cant comment on that aspect  gps locks on quickly  and wi fi connects reliably  battery life the idol  s battery life is a dream compared to my old htc inspire  which i had to recharge throughout a typical workday im easily getting thru my workday with charge to spare the battery charges quickly too  due to the  amp wall chargercons  an occasional ui stutter  as mentioned above  the volume sliders can only be set to   incremental  discrete intervals i wish the volume sliders were continuously variable like the brightness slider  the idol  s vibration mode is very weak if the phone is set to vibrate mode and its laying on my desk  i often cannot detect when a vibrating call or text is coming in  if you have the double tap feature enabled  you sometimes have to repeatedly double tap in order to wake the screen up  particularly when its been asleep for an extended period  this is big phone and will take a bit of getting used to if you have smaller hands although  i must say its nicely balanced i have medlarge hands and didnt find the idol   particularly slippery or hard to grip  the user manual is not very comprehensive tech support is located in guadalajara  mexico i called tech support to address a few questions i had the support i received was of average competence   not terrible but not greatin conclusionthe overall performance of the idol   at the   price point is outstanding its half the price of  say  an lg g   and side by side  stacks up nicely the phone does everything i ask of it and then some call quality is good  the speakers kick some serious butt  the screen resolution and brightness are superb  the camera works great for me  and battery life is excellent unless you just have to have top tier specs  this is the best bang for the buck smartphone on the market,30,798,Positive,4.045112781954887,4238,736

Apple iPhone 3G 8GB (Black) - AT&T,APPLE,24.6,1,worst iphone ever do not buy this phone  its more of a paperweight than a phone there are so many problems with the  g the ios is     which basically means that there are very few apps for this phone cant get any of the major apps like facebook  twitter  google  youtube  amazon  pinterest  and so fourth most of the apps are for ios    and above it took me days to actually finds some apps by searching the internet the phone has a static sound when making a phone call  it is hard to hear the person on the other end surfing on the internet is so slow and it takes pages too long to load  my cheap tablet is faster than this phone now on to the problems with my phone it makes a weird clicking noise when i unlock the phone my phone was attached to another account when i tried to download music  had to erase the phone and start over i cant get apps in the app store on the phone because it has another email attached to the phone  so if i wanted to get apps  i have to go to itunes and add the apps from there tried to contact the seller to return the phone and never received a reply going to reset the phone back to factory settings to turn it into an ipod or back up phone my advice is to purchase an iphone  s or higher if you have the money  even a  gs would be better or just get a samsung phone it would be a good backup phone to have  a good ipod player  a good digital picture frame or to give to a child with some games to play but as an actual phone  stay away,0,152,Negative,3.3552631578947367,1501,300

Apple iPhone 3GS A1303 16GB GSM Unlocked SmartPhone - Black,APPLE,39.0,4,i was skeptical about buying the unlock iphone  gs from amazon after seeing the bad reviews  but i checked with the seller and went ahead and purchased it after he confirmed it i gotta say  im very happy with this purchase it wasnt hard to set up the sims card into the device it came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything i love texting and calling my friends and family with it i have experienced the white screen of death  but i restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since i havent really experience any serious heating problems and ive played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in it does get rather warm in the hands  but it wasnt enough to be uncomfortable for me the main reason why i got this phone was because i wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family the phone i had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard this does what i want and so much more for    i got a really good deal and im happy to say that ill be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me just to let those who have flip phones know  the iphone  gs can prevent data being used when youre not on that plan the flip phone that i had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet at least now  i dont have to worry about those slippages because i can only use data when im using wi fii dont really have any complaints for this phone because its more then what i want in an phone  but as an apple product  i have to say that the screen really takes a miss im so spoiled by retina display on my ipod touch  g  that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution when comparing watching videos or pictures  its just aint the same its good when im bored at college  but for casual use  its not that great from todays standardsits a little bulky  but i kind of like it that way it gives it a feel to it and it doesnt slip out of my hands unlike the new ipod touchseeing that i got the white screen of death on the second day scared me im hoping that wasnt the reason why the seller sold it to mesummeryprosgreat for a phone and great for textinghas great cellular connectionsatisfying battery lifecan handle playing games without taking too much heatcan prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phoneconspoor screen quality compared to todays standard for apple productssort of bulky  but having some weight is a pro for mewhite screen of death on the second day of using it,0,152,Positive,3.2039473684210527,2708,507
